# ConnectFour-Game
Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game played on a vertical grid of seven columns and six rows, and the objective is to connect four of your colored disks in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, before your opponent does the same. The game requires players to carefully plan their moves, as they must try to connect their disks while also blocking their opponent's attempts to do the same. It is a game of skill that requires players to think ahead and make strategic decisions. 

This project is created where AI is playing against a player. The program provides a graphical user interface and uses two AI algorithms to determine the computer's moves and make informed decisions based on the current state of the game.

Algorithm used are:
1. Mini-Max Algorithm
2. Alpha Beta Pruning
